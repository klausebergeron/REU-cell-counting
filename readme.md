This model is a replication of the model described in the [AlexNet](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks) publication.

It has been adjusted from its original intended data classification by parameter changes optimizing it to classify Microscopy cell images by cell count, and retrained on a data set of 22,800 (similar) images.

This model was trained by Claudia Bergeron and Richard Gandalfo
